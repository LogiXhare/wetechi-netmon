# Functional Requirements

Status: Phase 0 draft
Last updated: 2026-08-20

Requirements are grouped by logical service (section 5 of the master
prompt). Each is stated as a capability, not an implementation. IDs are
stable identifiers for future traceability from tests and acceptance
criteria.

## FR-1 Telemetry Collector

- FR-1.1 Receive and decode IPFIX (priority 1), NetFlow v9 (priority 2),
  NetFlow v5 (priority 3), sFlow v5 (priority 4)
- FR-1.2 Bind to configurable interfaces and UDP ports
- FR-1.3 Decode template records, data records, and option templates
- FR-1.4 Cache templates per exporter; handle exporter restarts, template
  changes, and sequence-number resets
- FR-1.5 Recognize observation domains and track exporter uptime
- FR-1.6 Apply sampling correction using exporter-declared sampling rate
- FR-1.7 Record active/inactive timeout metadata
- FR-1.8 Detect and count malformed packets, unknown templates, unsupported
  fields, parser failures, and socket receive-buffer drops
- FR-1.9 Support exporter allowlists and exporter authentication where
  technically possible
- FR-1.10 Support multiple collector instances and horizontal partitioning
- FR-1.11 Support packet replay for testing

## FR-2 Traffic Aggregation

- FR-2.1 Compute bps, pps, fps, total bytes/packets/flows, and per-protocol
  (TCP/UDP/ICMP), fragmented, and TCP-SYN traffic
- FR-2.2 Aggregate along: source host, destination host, IPv4/IPv6 prefix
  (configurable length, incl. /24 and /48), hostgroup, ASN, exporter,
  input/output interface, protocol, TCP flags, tenant, customer, site, data
  center
- FR-2.3 Support time windows: 1s, 5s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h
- FR-2.4 Bounded memory, deterministic expiration, backpressure,
  high-cardinality protection, configurable top-N limits
- FR-2.5 Exporter-specific sampling correction, late-record handling,
  clock-skew handling

## FR-3 Direction Classification

- FR-3.1 Classify each flow as Incoming, Outgoing, Internal, or Other using
  configured local network prefixes and longest-prefix matching
- FR-3.2 Support IPv4 and IPv6, tenant-aware prefix ownership, prefix
  conflict/duplicate detection
- FR-3.3 Expose a diagnostic endpoint that explains a given classification
  decision

## FR-4 Detection Engine

- FR-4.1 Static threshold detection across Mbps/PPS/FPS and per-protocol
  (TCP/UDP/ICMP/TCP-SYN/Fragmented/Dropped) variants
- FR-4.2 Threshold scopes: per-host, per-prefix, total hostgroup, total
  network, per-ASN, per-exporter-interface, per-tenant, per-customer
- FR-4.3 Directional thresholds: incoming, outgoing, both, independent
- FR-4.4 Minimum trigger duration, hysteresis, cooldown, hold-down,
  re-trigger suppression, maximum alert frequency, maintenance windows,
  allowlist/denylist
- FR-4.5 Operating modes: dry-run, alert-only, manual mitigation, automatic
  mitigation
- FR-4.6 (Later) statistical detection: EWMA, MAD, hour-of-day/day-of-week/
  seasonal baselines, minimum training period, cold-start protection,
  explainable anomaly score, confidence score, baseline versioning
- FR-4.7 Classify attack category (UDP flood, TCP SYN flood, TCP flood,
  ICMP flood, fragmentation flood, DNS/NTP/SSDP/CLDAP amplification
  indicators, multi-vector, distributed subnet, carpet-bomb) without
  claiming definitive attribution when telemetry is insufficient

  NO_ADVERTISE, AS-path prepend, announce/withdraw
- FR-6.3 Restart reconciliation, route ownership, stale-route recovery,
  peer-state monitoring

  prefix allowlist, tenant prefix ownership, max announcement scope, min/max
  prefix lengths, manual approval for first production mitigation,
  emergency global disable, max mitigation duration, automatic withdrawal,
  duplicate-action protection, idempotency, full audit trail

- FR-15.3 Reporting service (CSV/JSON/PDF) and backup/restore service for

## Traceability

Each FR ID above must map to acceptance criteria in
[acceptance-criteria.md](acceptance-criteria.md) and to test cases when the
owning phase is implemented. FRs not scheduled for the MVP are flagged in
[mvp-scope.md](mvp-scope.md) / [out-of-scope.md](out-of-scope.md).
