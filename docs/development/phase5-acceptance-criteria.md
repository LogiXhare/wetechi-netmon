# Phase 5 Acceptance Criteria

Status: **Planning only.** Two distinct gates below: what makes the
*planning* complete (this session's deliverable), and what will make the
*implementation* complete (a future gate, listed so it is not invented
retrospectively).

## Gate 1 — Planning complete

| 29 | Performance plan defined; no number claimed | Done |
| 30 | Community/Enterprise seam defined | Done — [ADR 0017](../architecture/decisions/0017-incident-community-enterprise-boundary.md) |
| 31 | Implementation milestones defined | Done — [implementation plan](phase5-implementation-plan.md) |
| 32 | Out-of-scope items explicit | Done |
| 33 | No dependency added | Verified |
| 34 | No production code added | Verified |
| 35 | No migration created | Verified |
| 36 | MkDocs strict passes | Verified |
| 37 | Markdown lint passes | Verified |
| 38 | YAML validation passes | Verified |

**Gate 1 is PASSED as of 2026-08-22.** All five blocking questions —
BQ-5 through BQ-9 — are resolved and recorded with dates, rationale, and
impact; see [blocking questions](../blocking-questions.md).

No Phase 5 planning decision remains outstanding. What stands between
here and Milestone 5B is crate selection under
[ADR 0018](../architecture/decisions/0018-phase5-dependency-selection.md),
which is implementation work with verification requirements rather than
an open architectural question.

Milestone 5A may begin once the planning branch is reviewed and merged.

**Milestone 5A implementation is complete** — merged to `main` via PR #16,
merge commit `2cd116d`, 2026-08-24, after two Opus 5 adversarial review
cycles (2 Blocker + 7 High found and fixed, then a focused re-review
finding 0 Blocker/0 High) and a final pre-merge review (0 Blocker/High/
Medium, 1 new Low finding recorded as FU-41, 1 wording correction).

## Gate 1B — Phase 5B planning complete

The deliverable of the Phase 5B Stage A/B planning session
(2026-08-24). Mirrors Gate 1's structure for the persistence layer
specifically.

**Gate 1B is PASSED as of 2026-08-24**, pending owner review of the
planning branch. Milestone 5B implementation (5B-0 onward) begins once
that review approves this document set and the Phase 5B-1 dependency
probe (§ Gate 1B row 5–10 follow-ups) clears.

## Gate 2 — Implementation complete

A future gate. Listed now so it is defined before the work starts rather
than assembled afterwards to match whatever was built.

### Functional

- Detection events ingest through the outbox, at-least-once, with
  effectively-once processing.
- Correlation is deterministic and order-independent, proven by property
  test.
- Duplicate events never create a second incident, for any interleaving.
- Every legal transition works; every illegal one is refused with a
  stable error code.
- The five end reasons are distinguished and surfaced through the API.
- Recovery, abort-with-prior-state-restoration, auto-close, and reopen
  all behave per configuration.
- A detector restart mid-attack yields **one** incident, not two.
- A detector that goes silent leaves no incident open forever.
- Assignment, notes with supersession, severity and priority changes all
  work and are audited.
- The REST API implements every planned endpoint.
- The CLI implements every planned command.

### Non-functional

- Every mutation is atomic across state, timeline, audit, and outbox,
  **proven by injected failure at each commit point**.
- An audit write failure rolls back the mutation.
- Optimistic concurrency prevents lost updates.
- Idempotent retries are safe; key reuse with a different body conflicts.
- Tenant isolation holds across every endpoint; cross-tenant returns
  `404`.
- Every capacity limit is enforced with defined breach behaviour.
- The timeline is never truncated.
- Prometheus label sets are asserted against an allowlist by a test.
- No note body appears in a log at `INFO` or above.
- Benchmarks are **run and published with real numbers**.
- Backup and restore are **tested**, not assumed.

### Safety — the non-negotiables

- **No notification is delivered by any code path**, proven by a
  recording sink that must receive nothing.
- **No mitigation is attempted**, proven structurally by the incident
  crate's dependency closure containing no BGP, firewall, router, SMTP,
  or chat-delivery crate — the same verification ADR 0007 uses for the
  detector.
- `executed` remains `false` on every linked detection event.
- `mitigation_status` and `notification_status` are `none` on every
  incident.
- Phase 4 detector behaviour is unmodified.
- ClickHouse remains on `0.13`.
- No Dependabot PR merged as part of Phase 5.

### Process

- All 403 existing tests green, plus the Phase 5 suite.
- Every gate exit 0.
- DCO on every commit.
- ADRs 0011–0017 moved from Proposed to Accepted, or superseded.
- FR-5.1 updated to reference ADR 0014, so the requirement and the
  implementation stop disagreeing.
- Documentation updated: installation, configuration, operations,
  runbook, API reference.
- Risk register updated; R16–R18 reassessed.

## Known limitations to carry forward

Even a complete Phase 5 will still have these, and they should be stated
rather than discovered:

- Tenant isolation is application-enforced until Phase 8 RLS (**R16**).
- Output escaping cannot be proven until a UI exists (**R17**).
- Evidence storage is undesigned (**R18**, **FU-23**).
- Exporter and interface identity are absent from detection events, so
  FR-5.2 cannot be fully satisfied without a Phase 4 change (**FU-16**).
- Baseline metrics are always `NULL` — Phase 4 has no baselining.
- Correlation is single-node.
- GitHub-hosted CI remains billing-blocked (**FU-1**), so Phase 5
  evidence will again be local-only.
