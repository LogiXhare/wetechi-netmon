# Incident Management Configuration — Plan

Status: **Planning only.** Part of the
[Phase 5 plan](../architecture/phase5-incident-management-plan.md).
**None of these settings exist yet.** No environment variable listed here
is read by any binary at `3f0cf3e`.

Phase 5 follows the configuration conventions the collector already uses:
environment variables, a `WETECHINETMON_` prefix, no hardcoded hosts or
credentials, and a startup failure rather than a silent fallback when a
value is invalid.

## Storage

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `INCIDENT_DB_URL` | — | **Required.** PostgreSQL connection URL |
| `INCIDENT_DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | `16` | Pool ceiling |
| `INCIDENT_DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `10` | |
| `INCIDENT_DB_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `30` | Bounds a runaway query |
| `INCIDENT_DB_APPLICATION_NAME` | `wetechinetmon-incident` | Shows in `pg_stat_activity` |

The credential belongs in the URL, and the URL belongs in the
environment — never in a committed file, never on a command line where it
lands in shell history and process listings. Logs must show the host and
database name only, never the full URL.

## Correlation

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `INCIDENT_REOPEN_WINDOW_SECS` | `900` | 15 min (BQ-9). Range **0–86400**; `0` disables reopening entirely. Boundary is **inclusive** |
| `INCIDENT_RECOVERY_CONFIRMATION_SECS` | `300` | `Recovering` hold before `Resolved` |
| `INCIDENT_DETECTOR_SILENCE_SECS` | `0` | `0` means derive: 3 × window, minimum 300 |
| `INCIDENT_AUTOMATIC_CLOSURE_ENABLED` | `true` | Master switch for non-critical auto-close |
| `INCIDENT_AUTOMATIC_CLOSURE_DELAY_SECS` | `1800` | 30 min. `Resolved` → `Closed` for **non-critical** incidents |
| `INCIDENT_CRITICAL_MANUAL_CLOSURE_REQUIRED` | `true` | **Secure default.** Critical incidents never auto-close (BQ-8) |
| `INCIDENT_OBSERVE_MODE_INGEST` | `true` | Ingest `Observe` events for counting; they never open incidents |

`INCIDENT_DETECTOR_SILENCE_SECS = 0` deriving from the detection window
rather than taking a fixed default is deliberate: a policy with a
60-second window and one with a 5-second window need different silence
thresholds, and a single global number would be wrong for one of them.

**Two settings changed on 2026-08-22** when BQ-8 was resolved.
`INCIDENT_AUTO_CLOSE_MIN_SEVERITY` is gone, replaced by the explicit
boolean `INCIDENT_CRITICAL_MANUAL_CLOSURE_REQUIRED` — a rule stated
plainly rather than encoded in a severity comparison. The closure delay
dropped from 24 hours to 30 minutes: with critical incidents excluded
from auto-close entirely, the delay now governs only incidents nobody was
going to review, and a day of those in the queue serves nobody. Both are
**changes to previously documented defaults**, not new settings, and a
deployment carrying the old variable names will fail startup validation
rather than silently ignoring them.

The env-var form above follows the collector's existing convention. The
owner's decision expressed the same settings as a JSON concept
(`criticalManualClosureRequired`, `automaticClosureEnabled`,
`automaticClosureDelay`); the semantics are identical and the naming here
matches the repository rather than the sketch.

### Overriding critical manual closure

`INCIDENT_CRITICAL_MANUAL_CLOSURE_REQUIRED=false` is a deliberate act, not
a tuning knob, and the override path has requirements the plain env var
cannot express on its own:

| Requirement | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Explicit | No implicit inheritance; unset is `true`, never `false` |
| Tenant-aware | Overrides name a tenant; a global override is itself an explicit, separately audited choice |
| Policy-aware where supported | Per-policy override permitted where policies are modelled; otherwise tenant is the finest grain |
| Permissioned | Requires `incident.closure_policy.override`, absent from every default operator bundle |
| Immutably audited | Every override writes an audit record: actor, scope, old value, new value, reason |
| Visible | Appears in effective-configuration diagnostics |

### Effective-configuration diagnostics

A read-only endpoint and CLI view answering one question directly:
**"will a critical incident on this tenant auto-close, and why?"**

For each effective setting it reports the value, its source
(`default`, `environment`, `tenant override`, `policy override`), and
when an override was last changed and by whom. Requires
`incident.config.read`. It never returns credentials — the database URL
is reported as host and database name only, never with its password.

The reason this exists rather than being left to "read the config file"
is that overrides are layered, and a layered configuration nobody can
introspect is one where an operator discovers the effective value from an
incident that closed when they expected it not to.

## Ingestion

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `INCIDENT_INGEST_BATCH_SIZE` | `500` | |
| `INCIDENT_INGEST_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | `1000` | Fallback when `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` is unavailable |
| `INCIDENT_INGEST_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | `5` | Then dead-letter |
| `INCIDENT_INGEST_BACKOFF_BASE_MS` | `500` | Exponential, with jitter |
| `INCIDENT_INGEST_BACKOFF_MAX_MS` | `60000` | |
| `INCIDENT_SUPPORTED_EVENT_SCHEMA_MAX` | `1` | Higher versions are quarantined, never guessed |

## Limits

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `INCIDENT_MAX_OPEN_PER_TENANT` | `10000` |
| `INCIDENT_MAX_EVENTS_PER_INCIDENT` | `10000` |
| `INCIDENT_MAX_TIMELINE_ENTRIES` | `50000` |
| `INCIDENT_MAX_NOTES_PER_INCIDENT` | `500` |
| `INCIDENT_MAX_NOTE_BYTES` | `16000` |
| `INCIDENT_MAX_TAGS` | `32` |
| `INCIDENT_MAX_AFFECTED_TARGETS` | `256` |
| `INCIDENT_MAX_PAGE_SIZE` | `200` |
| `INCIDENT_MAX_EXPORT_ROWS` | `10000` |
| `INCIDENT_MAX_QUERY_RANGE_DAYS` | `90` |

`INCIDENT_MAX_TIMELINE_ENTRIES` is an **alert threshold, not a truncation
point**. The timeline is never truncated; reaching this number raises
`wetechinetmon_incident_timeline_pressure`.

## Retention

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `INCIDENT_RETENTION_CLOSED_DAYS` | `730` |
| `INCIDENT_RETENTION_AUDIT_DAYS` | `730` |
| `INCIDENT_RETENTION_IDEMPOTENCY_HOURS` | `24` |
| `INCIDENT_RETENTION_OUTBOX_PUBLISHED_DAYS` | `7` |
| `INCIDENT_RETENTION_DEAD_LETTER_DAYS` | `90` |

Audit retention must be **greater than or equal to** incident retention.
A configuration where audit expires first should fail at startup, not be
discovered during an investigation.

Dead-letter rows are never purged while unreviewed, regardless of this
setting.

## API

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `INCIDENT_API_BIND` | `127.0.0.1:8081` |
| `INCIDENT_API_RATE_MUTATIONS_PER_MIN` | `60` |
| `INCIDENT_API_RATE_QUERIES_PER_MIN` | `120` |
| `INCIDENT_API_RATE_EXPORTS_PER_HOUR` | `5` |
| `INCIDENT_API_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `30` |
| `INCIDENT_API_MAX_BODY_BYTES` | `65536` |

Binding to loopback by default is deliberate. An incident API reachable
on every interface the moment it is installed is a configuration mistake
waiting to happen; exposing it should be a decision an operator makes.

## Analytics export

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `INCIDENT_ANALYTICS_ENABLED` | `false` |
| `INCIDENT_ANALYTICS_BATCH_SIZE` | `200` |
| `INCIDENT_ANALYTICS_FLUSH_INTERVAL_SECS` | `10` |

Reuses the collector's existing ClickHouse configuration rather than
introducing a second URL, so there is one place to change the endpoint.

## Validation at startup

Following the collector's existing pattern, an invalid value is a startup
error, never a silent fallback.

Specific to the 2026-08-22 decisions:

- `INCIDENT_REOPEN_WINDOW_SECS` must be **0–86400**. Zero is valid and
  means recurrence always creates a new incident. Above the maximum is a
  startup error, not a clamp — a clamped value is one nobody notices is
  wrong.
- `INCIDENT_AUTOMATIC_CLOSURE_DELAY_SECS` must be greater than zero when
  `INCIDENT_AUTOMATIC_CLOSURE_ENABLED` is true.
- `INCIDENT_CRITICAL_MANUAL_CLOSURE_REQUIRED` must parse as a boolean;
  an unparseable value fails startup rather than defaulting either way,
  because defaulting it to false would silently remove a safety property
  and defaulting it to true would hide a typo.
- The removed `INCIDENT_AUTO_CLOSE_AFTER_SECS` and
  `INCIDENT_AUTO_CLOSE_MIN_SEVERITY` are **rejected if present**, so a
  deployment carrying the old names is told rather than silently running
  with new defaults.

And generally: the database URL must be
present and parseable; `recovery_confirmation` must be greater than zero;
audit retention must be at least incident retention; every limit must be
greater than zero; `auto_close_after` must exceed
`recovery_confirmation`; and the bind address must parse.

## Not configurable, deliberately

Some things are invariants rather than policies, and exposing them as
settings would invite a deployment to turn off its own correctness:

- Whether mutations write audit records.
- Whether the timeline is append-only.
- Whether tenant isolation is enforced.
- Whether illegal transitions are refused.
- Whether `executed`, `mitigation_status`, and `notification_status` can
  be anything other than false or `none` in Phase 5.
