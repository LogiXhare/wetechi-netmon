# Non-Functional Requirements

Status: Phase 0 draft
Last updated: 2026-08-20

## NFR-1 Performance

- Collector must sustain high flow-record ingest rates on commodity
  hardware without unbounded memory growth (specific target pps/fps to be
  set once reference hardware is confirmed — see
  [blocking-questions.md](blocking-questions.md)).
- Aggregation and detection latency must be bounded and observable via
  Prometheus metrics (`aggregation_latency`, `detection_latency`).
- API p99 latency and error budgets to be defined in Phase 9 (production
  hardening) once real workload data exists; no fabricated numbers before
  then.

## NFR-2 Reliability and Availability

- Every service exposes health and readiness endpoints.
- Collector must tolerate exporter restarts, template changes, and
  sequence-number resets without data corruption.
- Mitigation controller must reconcile BGP state after its own restart
  (no orphaned or duplicate routes).
- Backup and restore must be tested, not assumed to work.

## NFR-3 Scalability

- Aggregation must support configurable top-N limits and high-cardinality
  protection so a single noisy exporter or attack cannot exhaust memory.
- Architecture must support horizontal partitioning of collectors and
  eventual distributed/HA deployment (v2.0.0 milestone).
- Multi-tenancy must not require re-architecture — tenant scoping is a
  first-class dimension from the schema level up, even though RBAC/tenancy
  ships in later phases.

## NFR-4 Security

- Least privilege, rootless services where practical, dedicated service
  accounts, read-only filesystems, seccomp/AppArmor where applicable.
- TLS required for all external interfaces; optional mTLS internally.
- No secrets in Git, ever — environment variables, secret managers, or
  platform secret stores only.
- Full detail in [security-principles.md](security-principles.md).

## NFR-5 Safety (mitigation-specific)

- BGP mitigation is dry-run and disabled by default at every layer.
- No automatic enabling of production BGP by the software itself.
- Authorized-prefix allowlists and tenant prefix ownership are mandatory
  before any real announcement, even in dry-run-tested lab environments.
- No real DDoS traffic generation, ever, in any test or demo.

## NFR-6 Maintainability

- Each service has a clear, single responsibility, versioned interfaces,
  and its own configuration reference and failure-mode documentation.
- Conventional Commits and small, focused commits are required.
- Documentation is updated in the same pull request as the corresponding
  feature — it is not a follow-up task.

## NFR-7 Portability / Deployment

- Must run via Docker Compose, Kubernetes (Helm), and bare-metal
  systemd on Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 LTS.
- No hardcoded customer domains, passwords, addresses, ASNs, SMTP
  credentials, API keys, or private keys in application code, under any
  deployment target.

## NFR-8 Observability

- Every service ships Prometheus metrics and structured JSON logs from its
  first working version, not retrofitted later.
- Correlation IDs, trace IDs, incident IDs, and tenant IDs must be
  threadable through logs and traces end to end.

## NFR-9 Testability

- Protocol parsers must be fuzz-testable and property-testable from the
  start (Rust, no `unsafe` without a documented, reviewed reason).
- A safe synthetic/sanitized telemetry generator and replay tool is a
  required deliverable of Phase 2, not optional tooling.

## NFR-10 Licensing and Compliance

- Every third-party dependency must have a completed license record before
  it is added to the build (see
  [dependency-license-matrix.md](dependency-license-matrix.md)).
- No proprietary dependency may be combined with copyleft code without the
  legal/distribution implications being documented first.

## NFR-11 Internationalization / Accessibility

- Web UI must use a color-blind-safe, accessible palette; threshold status
  must never depend on color alone.
- No specific i18n/l10n requirement is set in Phase 0; treat English-only
  as the MVP default unless a blocking question surfaces a real need.

## NFR-12 Auditability

- Every operator and automation action affecting incidents, mitigations,
  configuration, or BGP state must be captured in an immutable audit trail,
  queryable per tenant.
