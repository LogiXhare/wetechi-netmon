# Incident API — Design

Status: **Planning only.** Design rationale; the endpoint-by-endpoint
reference and the draft OpenAPI live in
[docs/api/incident-api-plan.md](../api/incident-api-plan.md). No API is
implemented.

## Shape

Resource-oriented REST under `/api/v1`, with **state transitions as
sub-resource actions** rather than a `PATCH` on `state`.

`POST /incidents/{id}/acknowledge` rather than
`PATCH /incidents/{id} {"state": "acknowledged"}` — because a transition
is not a field assignment. It has its own permission, its own required
fields, its own idempotency semantics, and its own audit entry. Modelling
it as a field would mean inferring all four from the value being written,
and would let a client attempt an illegal transition by writing any state
name at all.

Reads are `GET` and are resource-shaped. Only transitions are actions.

## Conventions

| Concern | Rule |
|---|---|
| Version | `/api/v1`; breaking changes get `/v2` |
| Auth | Bearer token; `401` unauthenticated, `403` authenticated-but-unpermitted |
| Tenant | From the auth context, **never** from a request parameter |
| Cross-tenant | `404`, never `403` — see [security model](incident-security-model.md) |
| Unknown fields | **Rejected** with `400`, never ignored |
| Idempotency | `Idempotency-Key` required on transitions |
| Concurrency | `expected_version` required on transitions |
| Content type | `application/json` only |
| Timestamps | RFC 3339 UTC |
| Errors | RFC 9457 problem details plus a stable `error` code |
| Pagination | Cursor, never offset |
| Rate limits | `429` with `Retry-After` |

### Why cursor pagination, not offset

Incidents are inserted continuously during an attack — exactly when an
operator is paging through the list. With offset pagination, a new
incident at the top shifts every subsequent row down one, so page 2 shows
an item already seen on page 1 and skips another entirely. Cursor
pagination over an immutable sort key does not drift.

Cursors are opaque, signed, and encode the sort key plus tenant. A cursor
from another tenant is rejected rather than honoured, so cursors cannot
be used to cross the tenant boundary.

### Error body

```json
{
  "type": "https://wetechi.com/probs/incident-version-conflict",
  "title": "Version conflict",
  "status": 409,
  "detail": "The incident was modified by another actor.",
  "error": "incident.version_conflict",
  "request_id": "req_01H...",
  "current_version": 8,
  "expected_version": 6,
  "current_state": "resolved"
}
```

The `error` field is the stable, machine-readable contract. `title` and
`detail` are for humans and may be reworded; a client that switches on
`detail` is broken by design.

## Query surface

`GET /api/v1/incidents` filters: `state` (repeatable), `severity`,
`priority`, `category`, `direction`, `address_family`, `target`,
`target_type`, `policy_id`, `assigned_user`, `assigned_team`,
`unassigned=true`, `tag`, `opened_from`/`opened_to`,
`updated_from`/`updated_to`, `closed_from`/`closed_to`, `q` (substring
over title and target).

Sort: `opened_at`, `last_detected_at`, `severity`, `priority`,
`last_updated_at`; default `opened_at desc`. Page size default 50,
**maximum 200 enforced server-side** regardless of what the client asks
for.

Bounding rules, because an unbounded query is a denial-of-service
primitive that costs one request:

- Time-range filters are capped at 90 days per query.
- `q` requires at least 3 characters and is never a leading wildcard.
- Every filter combination must be index-supported; a request that would
  force a sequential scan is rejected with `400 incident.query_too_broad`
  rather than served slowly.
- Total result count is **not** returned by default — counting is the
  expensive part. `include_total=true` is available and separately rate
  limited.

## Endpoint summary

Full request and response schemas are in the
[API reference plan](../api/incident-api-plan.md).

| Method | Path | Permission | Idem. | Ver. |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/incidents` | `incident.list` | — | — |
| `POST` | `/incidents` | `incident.create` | Required | — |
| `GET` | `/incidents/{id}` | `incident.read` | — | — |
| `PATCH` | `/incidents/{id}` | `incident.update` | Optional | Required |
| `GET` | `/incidents/{id}/timeline` | `incident.read` | — | — |
| `GET` | `/incidents/{id}/notes` | `incident.read` | — | — |
| `POST` | `/incidents/{id}/notes` | `incident.note.create` | Optional | — |
| `GET` | `/incidents/{id}/detections` | `incident.read` | — | — |
| `GET` | `/incidents/{id}/audit` | `incident.audit.read` | — | — |
| `POST` | `/incidents/{id}/acknowledge` | `incident.acknowledge` | Required | Required |
| `POST` | `/incidents/{id}/assign` | `incident.assign` | Required | Required |

| `POST` | `/incidents/{id}/monitor` | `incident.investigate` | Required | Required |
| `POST` | `/incidents/{id}/severity` | `incident.severity.change` | Required | Required |
| `POST` | `/incidents/{id}/priority` | `incident.priority.change` | Required | Required |
| `POST` | `/incidents/{id}/resolve` | `incident.resolve` | Required | Required |
| `POST` | `/incidents/{id}/close` | `incident.close` | Required | Required |
| `POST` | `/incidents/{id}/reopen` | `incident.reopen` | Required | Required |
| `POST` | `/incidents/{id}/suppress` | `incident.suppress` | Required | Required |
| `POST` | `/incidents/{id}/unsuppress` | `incident.suppress` | Required | Required |
| `POST` | `/incidents/{id}/export` | `incident.export` | Optional | — |

`POST /incidents` exists for manual incident creation — an operator
opening an incident for something the detector cannot see. It is **not**
the ingestion path; detection events arrive through the outbox, never
over HTTP.

## Status codes

| Code | When |
|---|---|
| `200` | Success, including an idempotent replay |
| `201` | Incident created |
| `400` | Malformed body, unknown field, invalid ID shape, query too broad |
| `401` | Missing or invalid credentials |
| `403` | Authenticated, lacks the permission, **same tenant** |
| `404` | Not found, **or another tenant's resource** |
| `409` | Version conflict, illegal transition, idempotency reuse, state unchanged |
| `422` | Well-formed but semantically invalid, e.g. suppression with no expiry |
| `429` | Rate limited |
| `500` | Unexpected — no internal detail in the body |
| `503` | PostgreSQL unavailable; the API fails closed |

## What the API does not do

- **No notification.** No endpoint sends anything anywhere.
- **No mitigation.** No endpoint touches a router. There is no
  `/mitigate`.
- **No detection ingestion over HTTP.** That path is the outbox.
- **No customer-visible notes.** The field is accepted and setting it
  returns `501`, per the [domain model](incident-domain-model.md).
- **No bulk mutation.** Bulk close across a filter is a foot-gun that
  needs its own authorization design; deferred as **FU-22**.
