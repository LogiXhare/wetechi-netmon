# WetechiNetMon

**See Every Flow. Defend Every Network.**

WetechiNetMon is an independently engineered open network telemetry, DDoS
detection, traffic analytics, and policy-controlled mitigation platform
for ISPs, enterprises, data centers, hosting providers, and managed
network service providers.

> **Project status: Development Preview.** Phases 0–4 and Phase 5A are
> merged, with real, tested Rust source (collector, aggregator, detector,
> incident domain — 531 tests). Phase 5B (PostgreSQL persistence) is in
> planning. There is no packaged release, no HTTP API, no notification
> delivery, and mitigation is not implemented. See
> [Project Status](#project-status) below before evaluating this as a
> production-ready product.

Built by **WeTechi Solutions**.

## Project Status

**Development Preview.** This repository follows an explicit, phased
delivery model (see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)). Phases 0–4 and Phase 5A
are merged to `main`, each after adversarial review:

- **Phase 0–1**: product foundation, clean-room boundary, repository
  governance and documentation/validation tooling.
- **Phase 2–3**: IPFIX/NetFlow/sFlow telemetry collector, aggregation,
  and ClickHouse analytics storage.
- **Phase 4**: static-threshold detection engine.
- **Phase 5A**: dependency-free incident management domain (state
  machine, correlation, closure/reopen policy, idempotency) — 531
  workspace tests, zero third-party dependency added.
- **Phase 5B** (PostgreSQL persistence for incidents): architecture and
  dependency-selection **planning only**, not yet implemented — see the
  open documentation-only planning Pull Request.

**Explicit safety boundaries, current as of this preview:**

- No production BGP or FlowSpec mitigation execution — automated
  mitigation is disabled and dry-run by default at every layer,
  permanently (see [Security](#security) below).
- No notification delivery is implemented (Phase 6).
- No HTTP API or web UI is implemented yet (Phase 6).
- APIs, schemas, and storage architecture may still change.
- GitHub Actions cannot currently run on this repository because of an
  account billing limitation; validation evidence cited in Pull Requests
  is collected and reported locally instead.
- Production use is not yet recommended unless explicitly supported by
  WeTechi Solutions.

There is no packaged release yet — the first runnable component (the
IPFIX telemetry collector) shipped in Phase 2, and the repository has
carried real, tested source code since.

## What WetechiNetMon Is

WetechiNetMon is an independently engineered open network telemetry, DDoS
detection, traffic analytics, and policy-controlled mitigation platform.
Planned product categories:

- NetFlow / IPFIX / sFlow monitoring
- Network traffic analytics
- DDoS and network anomaly detection
- Incident management
- Grafana dashboards
- BGP RTBH and BGP FlowSpec automation
- Managed DDoS monitoring and policy-controlled mitigation

Full detail: [docs/product-charter.md](docs/product-charter.md).

## What WetechiNetMon Is Not

WetechiNetMon is not a clone, replica, copy, alternative build,
reverse-engineered edition, or replacement edition of any proprietary
product, named or unnamed. It is built exclusively from public RFCs,
public protocol specifications, vendor documentation, and independently
designed schemas and interfaces. See
[docs/clean-room-boundary.md](docs/clean-room-boundary.md) for the full,
binding clean-room policy.

## Architecture

WetechiNetMon is designed as a modular, event-driven platform of 15
logical services (Telemetry Collector, Traffic Aggregator, Direction
Classifier, Detection Engine, Incident Manager, Mitigation Controller,
Notification Service, Public REST API, Internal gRPC API, Web Application,
CLI, Configuration Service, Audit Service, Reporting Service, Backup and
Restore Service).

Architecture direction (not yet finalized — tracked via Architecture
Decision Records once decided):

- [docs/architecture-options.md](docs/architecture-options.md)
- [docs/technology-options.md](docs/technology-options.md)
- [docs/architecture/decisions/](docs/architecture/decisions/index.md)

*A visual architecture diagram will be added once the core service
boundaries are implemented (Phase 2–5) — a placeholder link only, no
diagram exists yet.*

## Core Capabilities (Planned)

| Area | Summary |
|---|---|
| Telemetry Collector | IPFIX, NetFlow v9/v5, sFlow v5 decoding with template caching and sampling correction |
| Aggregation | Traffic totals across host/network/hostgroup/ASN/exporter/interface dimensions |
| Detection | Static thresholds first, statistical/baseline anomaly detection later |
| Incident Management | Explicit incident state machine with full audit trail |
| Mitigation | GoBGP-integrated RTBH/FlowSpec, dry-run and disabled by default |
| Dashboards | Original Grafana dashboards and a native NOC web UI |
| Notifications | Email, Teams, Slack, Telegram, PagerDuty, generic webhook |
| Multi-Tenancy | Designed in from the schema level, enforced starting v1.1.0 |

Full requirement traceability:
[docs/functional-requirements.md](docs/functional-requirements.md) and
[docs/non-functional-requirements.md](docs/non-functional-requirements.md).

## Getting Started

There is no packaged release or installer yet. The Rust workspace
(`cargo build --workspace`, `cargo test --workspace`) builds and its 531
tests pass locally, but there is no HTTP API, web UI, or CLI to run
against real traffic yet — see
[docs/development/local-setup.md](docs/development/local-setup.md) for
what you *can* do today (build the workspace, run the test suite,
preview documentation, run Markdown/YAML validation). Installation
guides for Docker Compose, Kubernetes/Helm, and bare-metal Ubuntu will be
published once the corresponding phase ships a deployable service.

*Screenshots and a quick-start walkthrough will be added once the web
application and NOC UI exist (Phase 6) — placeholder only, no
screenshots exist yet.*

`crates/` (8 of them) and `tools/flow-replay/` now carry real, tested
source (see `Cargo.toml`'s `[workspace] members`). Every still-empty
directory contains a `README.md` explaining what it is reserved for and
which phase populates it — see [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the milestone summary and
[docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for full per-phase detail.

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for how to report a vulnerability, and
[docs/security-principles.md](docs/security-principles.md) for the
project's threat model and security design principles. **Automated BGP
mitigation is disabled and dry-run by default at every layer, permanently
— this is a hard safety rule, not a configuration default that will
change.**
