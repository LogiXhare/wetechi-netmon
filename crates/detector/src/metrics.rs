//! What the detection engine reports about itself.
//!
//! A trait rather than a concrete Prometheus type, for two reasons. The
//! collector already owns this project's registry and every metric name
//! in it, and giving the detector its own registry would mean two
//! `/metrics` endpoints or a merge step. And the detector's tests need
//! to assert on what was counted, which is far easier against a plain
//! counter than against a scraped Prometheus text body.
//!
//! The Prometheus implementation therefore lives in the collector,
//! alongside the metrics it already exposes. See
//! `wetechinetmon-collector`'s `metrics` module.
//!
//! # Label discipline
//!
//! Every method here takes only values from a closed set: a state, a
//! reason, a severity, a scope type, a direction, an event kind. None
//! takes an address, a tenant, a hostgroup, or a policy id. Phase 3
//! established that rule (see the collector's metrics module) and it
//! matters more here, not less — a detector labelled by target address
//! would grow one time series per attacked host.
