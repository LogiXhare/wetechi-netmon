//! Turning Phase 3 flows into detection snapshots.
//!
//! Phase 3's aggregator is deliberately two-sided and direction-blind:
//! a flow between A and B counts against both A and B, and the entry
//! says nothing about which way the traffic was going. That is right for
//! analytics — "how much did this host move" — and wrong for detection,
//! where "10 Gbps arriving at this host" and "10 Gbps leaving it" mean
//! entirely different things and need separate thresholds.
//!
//! So the detector keeps its own counters rather than reading the
//! aggregator's. It reuses the aggregator's public [`BoundedMap`] and
//! [`TrafficCounters`], and does not modify Phase 3.
//!
//! # Tumbling, not rolling
//!
//! Counters accumulate for one window and are then emitted and cleared.
//! A rolling window would need a per-scope ring buffer, and at a hundred
//! thousand scopes that is the difference between a few megabytes and a
//! few hundred. The cost is that a burst straddling a window boundary is
//! split across two snapshots; `triggerFor` spanning at least one full
//! window is what makes that acceptable, and policy validation enforces
//! it.
//!
//! # Which side is the target
//!
//! A scope is always the *local* side of a flow:
//!
//! | Direction  | Scoped on             | Reported as        |
//! |------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
//! | `Incoming` | destination           | `Incoming`         |
//! | `Outgoing` | source                | `Outgoing`         |
//! | `Internal` | destination *and* source | `Incoming` and `Outgoing` |
//! | `Other`    | nothing               | counted as unscoped |
//! | `Unknown`  | nothing               | counted as unscoped |
//!
//! `Internal` counting both sides is what makes an internal host being
//! flooded visible as incoming, and an internal host doing the flooding
//! visible as outgoing, without a separate scope type for either.
