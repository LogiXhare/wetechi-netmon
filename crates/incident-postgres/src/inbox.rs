//! The detection-event inbox (ADR 0035): the detector's producer enqueues
//! events, and the correlation worker claims them under a lease, ingests
//! each one, and records the outcome.
//!
//! - **Enqueue is idempotent.** A row is unique on `(tenant_id, dedup_key)`,
//!   so a batch sent twice adds nothing the second time.
//! - **Processing is effectively once.** A worker that ingests an event and
//!   crashes before [`InboxWorker::mark_processed`] leaves the row to be
//!   reclaimed when its lease expires; the second ingest is a `Duplicate`.
//! - **A poison event is never guessed at.** A payload that does not
//!   deserialize is dead-lettered at once. An event that deserializes with a
//!   newer `schema_version` reaches the domain, whose schema gate records it
//!   as `Quarantined`.
//! - **Other failures back off**, and are dead-lettered at the retry limit,
//!   into the same `incident_dead_letter` the outbox uses.
//! - **Clocks.** Every lease and backoff comparison uses PostgreSQL's
//!   `transaction_timestamp()`, as in [`crate::outbox`].
//! - **Scope.** Enqueueing is for one tenant. Claiming is across tenants and
//!   takes a [`PlatformAuthority`]; each event is then ingested under its own
//!   row's tenant.
