//! Retention jobs for the retention table in
//! `docs/architecture/incident-persistence.md`.
//!
//! [`run_retention`] deletes each class of row that is past its retention
//! and reports how many it deleted. Nothing here runs on a schedule; a later
//! milestone decides when to call it. These are platform maintenance jobs,
//! so they span every tenant.
//!
//! Deliberately never purged:
//!
//! - **Audit.** Its retention is "24 months minimum", with no maximum.
//!   Deleting an incident does not touch audit rows either, because
//!   `incident_audit` has no foreign key to `incidents`.
//! - **Unreviewed dead-letter rows**, at any age: one that aged out
//!   silently would be an incident nobody knew was missed.
//! - **Incidents that are not closed.**
//!
//! A purged closed incident takes its timeline, notes, tags, policy
//! references, assignments and detection-event links with it (`ON DELETE
//! CASCADE`). These are engineering defaults, not a legal or regulatory
//! claim (FU-20).
