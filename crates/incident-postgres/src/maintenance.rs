//! The incident timers (5C): the staleness sweep, recovery confirmation and
//! automatic closure, run as one pass across tenants.
//!
//! - **The query only proposes.** Each pass selects incidents that look due
//!   by PostgreSQL's `transaction_timestamp()`, then runs the domain call for
//!   each one as its own transaction. The domain call re-checks the timer
//!   against the incident as it reads it, so an event that arrived after
//!   the query keeps an incident open, and a resolved incident reopened
//!   and resolved again waits a full closure delay (FU-40).
//! - **One failure does not stop the pass.** A refused or failed incident
//!   is counted and the pass moves on; the next pass proposes it again.
//! - **Bounded.** Each of the three queries takes at most `batch_limit`
//!   incidents, oldest first. A backlog is worked off over several passes.
//! - **Scope.** The pass reads every tenant, so it takes a
//!   [`PlatformAuthority`] (ADR 0032). Each transition then runs under its
//!   own incident's tenant as the correlator, which holds `IncidentIngest`.
//! - **Critical incidents** are not proposed for automatic closure while
//!   the closure policy requires manual closure for them (BQ-8).
