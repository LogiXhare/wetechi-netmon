//! The `Incident` aggregate.
//!
//! Every field is `pub`, so this is discipline, not a type-system
//! guarantee: nothing here stops code that already holds `&mut Incident`
//! from setting a field directly and skipping a guard, a version bump, a
//! timeline entry, and an audit entry. What *does* hold is narrower than
//! that — no code outside this crate can ever obtain `&mut Incident` in
//! the first place, because [`crate::unit_of_work::IncidentUnitOfWork`]
//! keeps its incident map private and its only public accessor,
//! [`crate::unit_of_work::IncidentUnitOfWork::get`], returns `&Incident`.
//! Every external mutation path is therefore forced through a typed
//! command and [`crate::transition`]'s guards. Within the crate,
//! [`crate::unit_of_work`] is the only module that takes `&mut Incident`
//! with intent to change it, and each of its mutation sites is expected
//! to pair the field write with a version bump, a timeline entry, and an
//! audit entry — but that pairing is convention, verified by tests, not
//! something the compiler enforces (see FU-30's sibling entries in
//! `docs/development/follow-ups.md` for the specific sites reviewed).
