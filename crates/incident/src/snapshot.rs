//! The serializable rendering of an [`Incident`], and the only shape a
//! persistence adapter may speak.
//!
//! [`Incident`] derives `Debug, Clone, PartialEq` and nothing else. It has
//! no public constructor, and two of the fields its own logic depends on
//! — `state_before_recovering` (which drives `abort_recovery`) and
//! `matched_metrics` (which drives category derivation) — are
//! `pub(crate)` with no accessor. A row read back from PostgreSQL cannot
//! become a valid `Incident` today by any means available outside this
//! crate. That is the gap this module closes, and ADR 0030 fixes how:
//! through a separate DTO and a validating constructor, never through a
//! bare `#[derive(Deserialize)]` on the aggregate.
//!
//! The distinction matters because it is the difference between two
//! things that look alike. `Incident`'s module doc states its invariant:
//! every mutation goes through a method with intent to change it, and
//! every path that does so also appends a timeline entry, appends an
//! audit entry, and bumps `version`. A `Deserialize` impl on `Incident`
//! would accept whatever combination of field values a payload happened
//! to contain — an incident `Closed` with no `closed_at`, a `Critical`
//! one with `ever_critical` false, a `Recovering` one with no state to
//! recover to — reopening at the deserialization level exactly the class
//! of bypass the adversarial reviews' Blocker and High findings closed at
//! the method level.
//!
//! So the snapshot is a *dumb* type by design: it validates nothing,
//! because validation belongs to `Incident::reconstitute`, which is the
//! single door back into the aggregate. Read it as "what the row said",
//! not "what is true".
//!
//! # Field parity
//!
//! [`Incident::to_snapshot`] destructures `Incident` exhaustively, with
//! no `..` rest pattern. Adding a field to the aggregate therefore fails
//! to compile until it is carried here too — the parity check ADR 0030's
//! follow-up asks for, enforced by the compiler rather than by a test
//! that a future field could simply not be added to.
//!
//! # Where the shapes differ, and why
//!
//! - `suppression` is [`SuppressionDisplay`], the boundary DTO
//!   [`crate::suppression`] already defines for exactly this purpose, so
//!   there is one serializable rendering of a suppression rather than
//!   two that could drift.
//! - `matched_metrics` is a `Vec`, not the aggregate's `BTreeSet`.
//!   Deserializing a set silently absorbs duplicates; deserializing a
//!   sequence lets `reconstitute` *notice* them and reject the row, which
//!   is the whole point of having a validating door.
