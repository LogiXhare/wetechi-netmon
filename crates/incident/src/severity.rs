//! Severity and priority.

//! Severity is reused exactly from the detector's four-value scale —
//! [`wetechinetmon_detector::Severity`] — rather than a parallel incident
//! scale that would need a lossy mapping in both directions. Priority is
//! a separate, incident-domain-only concept: how urgently a human should
//! act, independent of the traffic's technical impact.
