//! The single door from an [`IncidentSnapshot`] back to a live
//! [`Incident`].
//!
//! [`crate::snapshot`] explains why a bare `#[derive(Deserialize)]` on
//! the aggregate is the wrong shape; this module is the right one. Every
//! check below exists because some guard elsewhere in the crate *already
//! assumes* the condition holds, and would misbehave rather than complain
//! if a database row arrived without it. The pairing is deliberate: this
//! is not a general-purpose schema validator, it is the set of
//! assumptions the domain makes about its own aggregate, written down
//! and enforced at the one place an aggregate can enter the process from
//! outside.
//!
//! Where each check comes from:
//!
//! - **`state_before_recovering` ⟺ `Recovering`.**
//!   [`crate::transition::abort_recovery`] returns
//!   `InternalInvariantViolation` when a `Recovering` incident has no
//!   state to restore. The only edges out of `Recovering` are the four
//!   abort edges and `Recovering -> Resolved`, and every one of them
//!   clears the field, so the biconditional holds in live code and a row
//!   that breaks it is corrupt.
//! - **`recovering_since` ⟺ `Recovering`.** Same edges, same clearing.
//! - **`resolved_at` ⟺ `Resolved` or `Closed`.** `Resolved -> Closed`
//!   keeps it; the reopen edges (`Resolved -> Open`, `Closed -> Open`)
//!   clear it; nothing else reaches those states.
//! - **`closed_at` ⟺ `Closed`, `closure_reason` ⟺ `Closed`.** Set
//!   together on close, cleared together on reopen.
//!   [`crate::transition::evaluate_reopen`] reads `closed_at` for a
//!   `Closed` incident and treats its absence as an internal invariant
//!   violation.
//! - **`Critical` implies `ever_critical`.** BQ-8's manual-closure
//!   protection is decided from `ever_critical`, never from the live
//!   `severity`, precisely so a downgrade cannot unlock automatic
//!   closure. A row claiming a `Critical` incident that was never
//!   critical would hand an attacker that unlock through the database
//!   instead of through the API.
//! - **`category` is derived.** It is recomputed from `matched_metrics`
//!   on creation and on every linked event, and no command sets it, so a
//!   row where the two disagree has been edited outside the domain.
//! - **The correlation key agrees with the denormalized fields.** The
//!   aggregate stores tenant, target type, target identity, direction,
//!   and address family both inside `correlation_key` and again beside
//!   it. Nothing in 5A can make the two disagree, and nothing checks
//!   that they do not; a row where they disagree would correlate as one
//!   incident and display as another.
//! - **Bounds and note indices.** Every capacity limit the mutation
//!   methods enforce before appending is re-enforced here, because a row
//!   is another way to append. Note indices are assigned as
//!   `notes.len()` and notes are never removed, so they are contiguous
//!   from zero.
//! - **Lifecycle ordering.** These became *expressible* only with ADR
//!   0031's durable timestamps: two `Instant`s from different processes
//!   could not be compared at all. A violation is evidence of the clock
//!   skew ADR 0031 requires be surfaced rather than absorbed, and an
//!   incident whose timestamps run backward cannot be trusted for the
//!   reopen decision that reads them.
//!
//! One deliberate omission: `priority` is **not** checked against
//! `Priority::default_for(severity)`. The `ChangePriority` command lets
//! an operator set priority independently of severity, so enforcing the
//! derived value here would reject rows the domain itself produces.
//! Over-constraining reconstitution is as much a defect as
//! under-constraining it — it just fails in the other direction, where
//! it looks like data loss rather than a security hole.
