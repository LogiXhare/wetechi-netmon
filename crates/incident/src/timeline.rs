//! The append-only timeline.
//!
//! Owner decision: no raw `serde_json::Value` as the primary payload.
//! [`TimelinePayload`] is a typed enum — a domain mutation can only ever
//! produce a structurally valid entry, because there is no variant that
//! accepts an arbitrary bag of JSON. [`TimelineEntry::payload_json`]
//! serializes to JSON **at the boundary**, for a future API or export
//! path; nothing inside this crate stores or compares JSON directly.
