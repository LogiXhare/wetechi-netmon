//! Deterministic correlation.
//!
//! The correlation key is built from **typed** target identity — the
//! detector's own [`ScopeId`] enum, whose address fields are
//! [`std::net::IpAddr`] — rather than from `EventTarget::display`, which
//! is only a human-readable rendering of the same value. This is not
//! merely a style preference: `IpAddr`'s `Eq`/`Hash`/`Ord` already
//! normalise on the parsed address bits, so `2001:DB8::1` and
//! `2001:db8:0:0:0:0:0:1` are the same key without any string
//! canonicalisation step, and there is no separate "canonical form" for a
//! bug to diverge from the "display form" of.
//!
//! Deliberately excluded from the key, per
//! [the correlation design](../../../docs/architecture/incident-correlation.md):
//! policy id, severity, and category. All three can change over an
//! incident's life without splitting it.
