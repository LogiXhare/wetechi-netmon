//! Shared aggregate fixtures for this crate's own tests.
//!
//! Compiled only under `cfg(test)`. It exists because three separate test
//! bodies — snapshot round-tripping, reconstitution invariants, and the
//! table-driven illegal-transition matrix FU-38 requires — each need a
//! valid [`Incident`] in an arbitrary state, and a `Incident { .. }`
//! literal repeated three times is three places to forget a field when
//! the aggregate grows.
//!
//! [`valid_incident`] returns an incident that satisfies every invariant
//! [`Incident::reconstitute`] enforces, so a test that wants to prove a
//! *violation* is rejected can start from a valid value and break exactly
//! one thing. A fixture that started out subtly invalid would make such a
//! test pass for the wrong reason.
