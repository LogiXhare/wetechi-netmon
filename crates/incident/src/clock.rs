//! rather than defining a second one: the same monotonic-for-control-flow,
//! wall-for-display split that Phase 4 proved out applies unchanged here,
//! and a second timestamp dependency (`chrono`, `time`, ...) would just be
//! two clocks disagreeing about what "now" means.
//!
//! [`Timestamp`] pairs a monotonic [`Instant`] with a wall [`SystemTime`]
//! reading taken at the same instant, mirroring the dual-stamp pattern
//! `StateTransition` uses in the detector (`at` / `at_wall`). Every
//! duration used for a domain decision — the reopen window, the recovery
//! confirmation period, an automatic closure delay, a suppression expiry —
//! is computed from the monotonic half only, using
//! [`Instant::saturating_duration_since`] so a clock correction or a
//! constructed-out-of-order timestamp cannot panic or produce a negative
//! duration. The wall half exists only so a timestamp can be displayed or
//! serialized; nothing here branches on it.
