//! The bounded, in-memory `IncidentUnitOfWork`.
//!
//! One store, not many concrete repositories — the approved Phase 5A
//! shape.
//!
//! **This is not a transaction, and 5A does not claim rollback.** Every
//! public mutation method validates everything it can — permission,
//! tenant, expected version, transition legality, capacity — *before*
//! touching `self`'s maps, so a predictable, non-injected error never
//! mutates anything (proven by the `_leaves_state_unchanged` family of
//! tests). But once a mutation begins, the incident write happens first
//! and the timeline/audit/outbox writes happen after; a failure between
//! them — reachable in 5A only through the test-only
//! [`IncidentUnitOfWork::inject_failure_after_incident_write`] hook —
//! leaves the incident mutated with no corresponding history. That gap is
//! real, is exercised by
//! `failure_injection_documents_the_in_memory_commit_boundary` in
//! `tests/domain_end_to_end.rs`, and is exactly what Milestone 5B's real
//! PostgreSQL transaction closes. Treat "exclusive in-process mutation
//! with pre-validated commands" as 5A's guarantee, not "atomic."
//!
//! Denied commands (owner decision 9) are handled by
//! [`IncidentUnitOfWork::check_permission`], called first in every
//! command-handling method, before the incident is even read mutably: a
//! denial returns before any of the incident, timeline, or outbox state
//! is touched, and writes exactly one [`crate::audit::AuditEntry::denied`].
//!
//! Correlation conflicts (owner decision 10) are never retried inside
//! this crate — [`crate::correlation::CorrelationConflict`] is returned
//! to the caller immediately. In 5A's single-threaded model a genuine
//! conflict can only arise from a caller re-entering with stale
//! information, which is exactly the case a bounded, non-retrying return
//! is correct for.
