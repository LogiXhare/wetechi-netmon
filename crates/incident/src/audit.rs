//! The audit trail — separate from the timeline, and the only place a
//! **denied** command is recorded.
//!
//! Owner decision: a denied command never mutates the incident, never
//! increments its version, never emits a normal mutation outbox event,
//! and produces exactly one denied audit record. [`AuditEntry::denied`]
//! and [`AuditEntry::allowed`] are two separate constructors rather than
//! one taking a boolean, so the call site states which happened instead
//! of computing it — and [`crate::unit_of_work`]'s denial path is
//! structured so the denial itself does not depend on whether the audit
//! write "succeeds": in this in-memory crate an append cannot fail, so
//! the denied result is returned to the caller regardless, which is the
//! correct direction for the stronger real-database rule ("if it can't
//! be audited, don't proceed") to specialise into once persistence
//! exists.
//!
//! Payloads are typed, matching [`crate::timeline::TimelinePayload`]'s
//! rule: no raw `serde_json::Value` as the primary record.
