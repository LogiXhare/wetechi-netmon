//! cargo-fuzz target for `wetechinetmon_protocol_ipfix::decode_message`.
//!
//! This is the coverage-guided complement to the `proptest` properties
//! in `crates/protocol-ipfix/src/lib.rs` — same "never panics on
//! arbitrary bytes" property, exercised via libFuzzer's mutation engine
//! instead of proptest's random sampling. Requires a nightly Rust
//! toolchain; see docs/development/local-setup.md for the local command
//! and `.github/workflows/fuzz.yml` for the scheduled CI run — neither
//! has been executed in the environment this was developed in (no
//! nightly toolchain installed here), flagged in docs/risk-register.md
//! R4, not silently skipped.
