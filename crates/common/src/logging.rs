//! Structured JSON logging setup, shared by every WetechiNetMon service.
//!
//! Per docs/non-functional-requirements.md (NFR-8) and
//! docs/security-principles.md, every service ships structured JSON logs
//! with configurable log levels from its first working version — this
//! module is that shared foundation, not a per-service reimplementation.

/// per process will panic, matching `tracing`'s own global-subscriber
/// contract — this is deliberate: silently ignoring a second call would
/// hide a programming error.
