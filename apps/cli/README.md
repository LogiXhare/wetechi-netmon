# wetechinetmonctl

The incident CLI ([Milestone 5E](../../docs/development/phase5-implementation-plan.md),
[ADR 0040](../../docs/architecture/decisions/0040-phase5e-cli-client.md)).

It is an API client and nothing more. Every command maps to an
[API endpoint](../api/README.md). It holds no business logic and never
touches the database, so authorization and audit cannot be bypassed by
using it.

## Status

Every command in the [CLI plan](../../docs/architecture/incident-cli-plan.md) is implemented. The CLI also covers opening an incident and tags, which the API gained in 5D.

## Connecting

Credentials are **never** command-line flags, because flags land in shell
history. The environment overrides the config file, field by field.

| Setting | Environment | Profile field |
|---|---|---|
| API URL | `WETECHINETMON_API_URL` | `url` |
| Token | `WETECHINETMON_API_TOKEN` | `token` |
| CA bundle (PEM) | `WETECHINETMON_API_CA_FILE` | `ca_file` |

The config file is JSON, at `$WETECHINETMON_CONFIG`. By default it is at
`~/.config/wetechinetmon/cli.json`, or `%APPDATA%\wetechinetmon\cli.json`
on Windows.

```json
{
  "default_profile": "noc",
  "profiles": {
    "noc": {
      "url": "https://wnm-api.example.net:8443",
      "ca_file": "/etc/wetechinetmon/ca.pem",
      "token": "wnm_..."
    }
  }
}
```

Keep the file readable only by you, because it holds a token.
`--profile NAME` picks a profile.

- **`https://` needs a CA bundle.** TLS verification cannot be turned off.
  On Linux, the system bundle works, for example
  `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`.
- **`http://` is accepted only for a loopback API.**

### Changing an incident safely

- **The version is read first.** A change sends the version it read, so if someone else changed the incident in between, the API refuses with `409`. `--expected-version N` pins the version instead of reading it.
- **A `409` is never re-issued.** It exits `4` and shows the current version and state. Someone else changed the incident, so you decide again.
- **One `Idempotency-Key` per command, reused on every retry.** A change that timed out and was retried is replayed by the server, never applied twice.
- **Some changes ask first:** closing, reopening, suppressing, and lowering severity. `--yes` answers in advance. With no terminal and no `--yes` the command is an error and sends nothing. Missing confirmation is never taken as a yes.

`INCIDENT` is the incident's id or its number, such as `WNM-2026-000123`.
A number is looked up in your tenant.

### Output formats

| Format | What it prints |
|---|---|
| `table` | For people. |
| `wide` | `table` with more columns. |
| `json` | The API's response body, **verbatim**. Errors are the API's problem document, so scripts switch on its `error` code. |

Text from the API, such as titles and notes, has its control characters
replaced before it reaches the terminal.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Success |
| `1` | Generic failure |
| `2` | Usage error, or input the API refused as malformed (`400`, `413`, `415`, `422`) |
| `3` | Authentication or authorization (`401`, `403`) |
| `4` | Conflict (`409`) |
| `5` | Not found (`404`) |
| `6` | Rate limited (`429`) |
| `7` | Unreachable, or the server failed after retries (`5xx`) |

Requests are retried only after a connection error or a `5xx`, at most
three times, and never after a `4xx`.
